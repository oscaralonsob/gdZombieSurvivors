Another small game used to learn Godot. This is gonna take a while probably.

The project runs in **Godot 3**.

### Features

Basic snake game in 2d, with almost not graphics:

- Moves arrong
- Collision
- Bullet spawn (hopefully object pooling)
- Some animations
- Endless world

### How to play

Move the player with the arrows (you must click over the game first). Shoot with <kbd>Space</kbd> in the direction where the mouse pointer is.
This game is not deployed yet. Come tomorrow to check if is already done :P.
